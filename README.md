# Hey There ðŸ˜‰
# Discount Calculator

A Python program that calculates the final price after applying a discount if the discount percentage meets the threshold.

## Features
- Calculates discounted price when discount is 20% or higher
- Returns original price for discounts below 20%
- Interactive user input for price and discount percentage
- Clear output showing the final price

## How It Works
The program uses a function called `calculate_discount()` that:
1. Takes two parameters: original price and discount percentage
2. Applies the discount only if it's 20% or higher
3. Returns either the discounted price or original price

## Usage
1. Run the program in a Python environment
2. Enter the original price when prompted
3. Enter the discount percentage when prompted
4. View the calculated final price


## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Code Structure
- `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` function
- User input prompts
- Formatted output
